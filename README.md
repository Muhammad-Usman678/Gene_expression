**Introduction**
This project analyzes gene expression data to uncover hidden structures using a variety of clustering techniques and visualization tools. The methods used include K-Means, DBSCAN, and Agglomerative Clustering. Visualization techniques such as UMAP are employed to present the data in a more interpretable form.

**Data Loading**
The data loading section covers the steps to import and preprocess the gene expression data required for analysis.

**Gene Expression Scatter Plot**
This section includes the creation of scatter plots to visualize the gene expression data. Scatter plots help in understanding the distribution and relationship between different gene expressions.

**K-Means Clustering**
K-Means clustering is applied to group the data into clusters based on their gene expression profiles. The results are evaluated to determine the optimal number of clusters.

**Evaluating Clusters with DBSCAN**
Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) is used to evaluate the clusters formed by K-Means and to identify any noise in the data.

**Agglomerative Clustering**
Agglomerative clustering, a hierarchical clustering method, is applied to further analyze the gene expression data. This method builds a hierarchy of clusters for better insights.

**Clusters Visualization with UMAP and KMeans**
UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is used alongside K-Means clustering for visualization. UMAP helps in reducing the dimensionality of the data, making it easier to visualize the clusters.

**Network with Community Detection**
This section involves creating a network from the gene expression data and applying community detection algorithms to identify tightly-knit groups within the network.

**Conclusion**
The conclusion summarizes the findings from the various clustering techniques and visualizations, providing insights into the gene expression data.
